# Siemens NX Sample Models

This repository is a **collection of Siemens NX Student Edition models** that I create and share for practice and learning.  
It includes various part files (`.prt`), drawings (`_dwg1.prt`), and assemblies.

##  Contents
- Part files (`*.prt`)
- Drawing files (`*_dwg1.prt`)
- Assembly files (`*_assembly*.prt`)

As I continue designing in Siemens NX, I will keep adding more models here.
